    "### What are lazy constraints?\n",
    "Mixed integer programming solver works on branch-and-bound strategy. Often in a mixed integer programming problem, including all possible constraints might be too space consuming or computationally too expensive. Instead we can start with a manageable set of constraints in a comparatively smaller, hence relaxed version of the original MIP. Once a feasible integer solution is found, we can check the status of the problem by solving some subproblem. The subproblem can be derived from duality, as in our current problem and/or from logic. In the case of suboptimality, we can add lazy constraints to cut off the current feasible solution at that node of the branch-and-bound tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy constraints have the following advantages:\n",
    "- does not revisit previously eliminated solution, and\n",
    "- does not discard the optimal solution to the original problem in favor of a better but ultimately infeasible solution to the relaxed one."

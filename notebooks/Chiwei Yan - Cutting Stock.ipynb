    "In this notebook, we deploy column generation to solve the cutting stock problem using Julia/JuMP. The origin of the cutting stock problem is in the paper industry. Given paper rolls of fixed width and a set of orders for rolls of smaller widths, the objective of the cutting stock problem is to determine how to cut the rolls into smaller widths to fulfill the orders in such a way as to minimize the amount of scrap. The cutting stock problem example we use in this notebook is from *Linear Programming* by Vasek Chvatal, 1983.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that rolls are produced in a uniform width of 100 inches and that orders can be placed for rolls of widths 14 inches, 31 inches, 36 inches, and 45 inches. The company has received the following orders:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n",
    "\\hline \\textrm{Order Width} & \\textrm{Quantity} \\\\\\hline\n",
    "  14  & 211 \\\\\\hline\n",
    "  31  & 395 \\\\\\hline\n",
    "  36  & 610 \\\\\\hline\n",
    "  45  & 97 \\\\\\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "A single 100 inch roll can be cut into one or more of the order widths. For example, one roll could be cut into two rolls of 45 inches with a 10 inch roll of scrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://neos-server.org/casestudies/cutting/roll.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a roll could be cut into a roll of 45 inches, a roll of 31 inches, and a roll of 14 inches with no scrap. Each such possible combination is called a pattern. For this example, there are 37 different patterns. Determining how many of each pattern to cut to satisfy the customer orders while minimizing the scrap is too difficult to do by hand. Instead the problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, specifically an integer linear program.\n",

However, it involves an advanced solution methodology called [branch-and-price](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_price) where column generation is applied on each node of the branch-and-bound tree. Unfortunately, commercial solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX) don't support this feature. Till now, the only academic solver supports branch-and-price is [SCIP](http://scip.zib.de/).\n",

    "It is troublesome to implement column generation on every node of the branch and bound tree. A common industry / research practice is to directly branch-and-bound the model only with columns generated from solving the LP relaxation. This is a heuristic because optimal set of cutting patterns for the IP might not be the same as the LP relaxation, i.e. we might lose some \"good columns\" to reach optimal integer solution. The upside is, it is very easy to implement with commercial solvers."
